Example in Python using Flask:
Here's a basic example of a RESTful web service for managing books using Flask, a Python micro web framework:

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request, abort

app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample data
books = [
    {"id": 1, "title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell"},
    {"id": 2, "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee"}
]

# Get all books
@app.route('/api/books', methods=['GET'])
def get_books():
    return jsonify({"books": books})

# Get a specific book by ID
@app.route('/api/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_book(book_id):
    book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
    if book is None:
        abort(404)
    return jsonify(book)

# Add a new book
@app.route('/api/books', methods=['POST'])
def add_book():
    if not request.json or not 'title' in request.json:
        abort(400)
    new_book = {
        "id": books[-1]["id"] + 1 if books else 1,
        "title": request.json["title"],
        "author": request.json.get("author", "")
    }
    books.append(new_book)
    return jsonify(new_book), 201

# Update an existing book
@app.route('/api/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['PUT'])
def update_book(book_id):
    book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
    if book is None:
        abort(404)
    if not request.json:
        abort(400)
    book["title"] = request.json.get("title", book["title"])
    book["author"] = request.json.get("author", book["author"])
    return jsonify(book)

# Delete a book
@app.route('/api/books/<int:book_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_book(book_id):
    book = next((book for book in books if book["id"] == book_id), None)
    if book is None:
        abort(404)
    books.remove(book)
    return '', 204

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
